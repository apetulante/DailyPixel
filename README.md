# DailyPixel 🎨

A daily challenge pixel art drawing app for Android that provides a daily prompt + color palette. Every user gets the same prompt so you can share with your friends!

Built because this was the app I wanted for me and my friends. Almost entirely coded with the help of Claude code.

## Current Features

- Over 900 prompts chosen at random daily
- A wide variety of pre-selected color palettes with 8 or 16 colors
- "Canvas" mode where you can free draw
- Flexible canvas options including **8x8**, **16x16**, and **24x24**
- Two drawing modes: cursor (for precision) and paint (for large areas)
- Hand-drawn sprite icons
